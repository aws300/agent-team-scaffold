# agent-team-scaffold

A **domain-agnostic scaffold for building an AI agent team** as a Claude Code /
Cowork plugin, built around one validated skeleton: the
**Planner → Generator → Evaluator** loop (Anthropic Engineering,
*Harness Design for Long-Running Apps* + *Building a Multi-Agent Research System*).

**Local-first** — use it directly in Claude Code or Cowork with no build step —
and the *same* agent assets deploy headless to **Claude Managed Agents (CMA)** via
one small Python compiler. One source, two surfaces. Copy this repo, fill in your
vertical, ship.

```
5 role agents · 1 reference workflow · 3 reference skills · 3 thin commands · 4 hooks · 2 rules
```

## The core idea: one source produces, a separate agent judges

LLMs grade their own work leniently. The single biggest lever for quality in a
long-running agent team is to **separate the agent that produces from the agent
that judges**, and to tune the judge to be skeptical. That separation is this
scaffold's skeleton:

```
Planner ──spec──▶ Design Evaluator ──APPROVE──▶ Generator ──build──▶ Evaluator ──PASS──▶ Resolver ──▶ ./out/
   ▲                    │ REVISE                                          │ FAIL
   └────────────────────┘                                                ▼
                                                                      Generator (fix & resubmit)
```

| Role | What it does | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Planner** | Decomposes the request into a sprint contract with binary, testable criteria | sprint contract |
| **Design Evaluator** | Adversarially challenges the *plan* before any build | APPROVE / REVISE |
| **Generator** | Implements against the approved contract (never self-certifies) | the deliverable |
| **Evaluator** | Adversarially challenges the *build*; the most important role | PASS / FAIL |
| **Coordinator** | Owns the loop: calibrates evaluators, resolves disputes (Opus) | — |

The Evaluators carry an explicit **anti-leniency mandate** — file the borderline
issue, don't rationalize it away; when in doubt, FAIL. See `docs/coordination-rules.md`.

> **Two governance layers, on purpose.** The plugin-root files (`plugin.json`,
> `hooks/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.lsp.json`, `monitors/`, `bin/`, root
> `settings.json`, `output-styles/`) take effect when this is **installed as a
> Claude Code plugin** — they use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` paths and are
> auto-discovered. The `.claude/` directory is the **local-development mirror**
> that takes effect when you just open the repo. The hook scripts are identical
> in both; edit `hooks/` and copy to `.claude/hooks/`.

### Why this layout
- **`agents/` is the core**: orchestration logic in plain markdown, organized by
  **loop role** rather than domain function. md is the only prompt source — local
  tools load it directly; the CMA layer *derives* its deploy JSON from it.
- **`commands/` is intentionally thin**: a few human entry points (intake, status,
  run-a-workflow). Everything else lives in `skills/` and runs *inside* the loop.
- **CMA stays in `scripts/`**: the project reads as pure agent orchestration;
  headless deployment is one Python file + one tiny manifest.

## Two surfaces, one source

| | Local (Cowork / Claude Code) | Managed Agents (headless) |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | `/agent-team:start` → a workflow command | steering event via `POST /v1/agents` |
| Orchestration | the workflow command drives `Task` delegation | `build.py` → orchestrator + depth-1 leaves |
| Source prompt | `agents/workflows/<wf>.md` | **the same file**, read by `build.py` |
| Role agents | `agents/specialists/**` (auto-discovered) | same md → each leaf's `system.text` |
| Approval | interactive (`AskUserQuestion`) | output staged in `./out/`, human sign-off |

---

## Plugin surface (team-level capabilities)

Installed as a Claude Code plugin, the scaffold wires the full plugin feature set. Everything is a
**runnable minimal example** — copy and adapt for your vertical.

| Capability | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Manifest** | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Identity, keywords, the **explicit agent list** (the nested `specialists/`+`workflows/` layout is preserved by listing each `.md` — `agents/` is a replace-default field), and the component references below. |
| **Hooks** (event-level, whole session) | `hooks/hooks.json` | `SessionStart` loads loop context; `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` append an audit trail; `PreToolUse(Bash)` guards risky pushes; `PostToolUse(Write\|Edit)` re-checks the CMA manifest. All via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. |
| **MCP** (global register, per-agent authorize) | `.mcp.json` | A filesystem MCP server over `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`. Registered globally; each subagent opts in via its frontmatter `tools:`/`mcpServers:`. |
| **LSP** | `.lsp.json` | A pyright language server (diagnostics fed back after edits). |
| **Monitor** (background) | `monitors/monitors.json` | `watch-out.sh` polls `./out/` and notifies when a deliverable is staged for sign-off. *(experimental)* |
| **Output style** | `output-styles/loop-verdict.md` | Verdict-first, evidence-cited communication that matches the loop's discipline. |
| **PATH binary** | `bin/cma-check` | `cma-check` on the Bash PATH while enabled — validates the CMA manifest from anywhere. |
| **Root settings** | `settings.json` | The only two supported keys: `agent: coordinator` (the loop owner is the main-thread default) and a `subagentStatusLine`. |
| **User config** | `plugin.json → userConfig` | Asked at enable time: **`default_model`** (the Sonnet-tier roles' model; export as `CMA_MODEL` for headless builds — coordinator stays opus) and **`evaluator_strictness`** (`standard` / `strict` / `panel`, read by the evaluators via `${user_config.evaluator_strictness}`). |

> **What stays per-agent (no global override exists):** `model`, `tools`, and `mcpServers` are
> declared in each agent's own frontmatter. The one exception is `settings.json`'s `agent` key,
> which promotes a single agent to the main thread. (See the research notes in `docs/`.)

## Low-code platform model: Agent → Project → Session → Context

This scaffold is the **fork-and-edit template** for an agent low-code platform: a user forks it and
edits only `cma.yaml` / md / json to define **Memory, Knowledge, Dreams, and per-agent Context** —
never touching the API. One **Agent** (this fork) runs many **Projects**; each Project runs many
**Sessions**; **Context lives only inside one session**. Memory `scope` (`agent`/`project`/`session`)
decides which sessions share a store. Chinese docs:
[`docs/platform-design.zh.md`](docs/platform-design.zh.md) (design) · [`docs/platform-guide.zh.md`](docs/platform-guide.zh.md) (how-to).

```
Agent (this fork) ── agent-scope memory/knowledge (shared by all projects)
 └─ Project ──────── project-scope memory/knowledge (isolated per project)
     └─ Session ──── one task; session-scope scratch
         └─ Context  ephemeral — gone when the session ends
```

`cma.yaml` now has `agent:` (identity + agent-scope memory/knowledge), `memory_stores:` /
`knowledge:` catalogs (each tagged `scope:`), and `projects:` (each lists its memory/knowledge +
workflows). `build.py` iterates **projects × workflows** and prints each session's `resources[]`
with scope-aware id placeholders (`${MEMSTORE_<KEY>__<PROJECT>}` etc.).

## Memory, knowledge, isolated context & dreams (Managed Agents)

The headless surface adds four Managed-Agents capabilities — see
[`docs/memory-and-dreams.md`](docs/memory-and-dreams.md) for the full, citation-backed guide.

- **Memory stores** are markdown collections attached **at session creation**
  (`resources[]`, mounted under `/mnt/memory/`), not fields on the agent. Scopes are a
  *pattern* of which store you attach with what `access`:
  - **Global** — `team-standards`, `read_only`, attached to every session (house standards).
  - **Project** — `project-context`, `read_write`, per project, outlives any session.
  - **Per-agent** — `evaluator-calibration`, attached only to the evaluator's session (its private memory).
  `cma.yaml` declares a `memory_stores:` catalog; workflows set `session_memory:` (global+project)
  and leaves set `memory:` (per-agent). `build.py` emits the session `resources[]` stanza —
  run `python3 scripts/cma/build.py deliver-feature` to see all three resolve.
- **Knowledge / RAG** — there is **no native vector index**. Knowledge = documents mounted in
  the sandbox (uploaded `file` resources or a `github_repository`), and "retrieval" = the agent's
  `grep`/`glob`/`read` over them (plus `web_search`/`web_fetch`). For semantic search, expose a
  vector DB as an **MCP server**. Mount the corpus `read_only`; let memory hold what the agent concludes.
- **Isolated context** — a `multiagent` coordinator runs each sub-agent in its **own
  context-isolated thread** with its own model/tools/MCP. For a truly private-memory agent,
  give it its own agent definition *and* its own session with only its store attached.
- **Dreams** — an async job that reads one store + past sessions and produces a **new,
  reorganized** store (input untouched). The coordinator schedules a dream over the
  calibration/project memory, human-reviewed before adoption.

```
global   →  team-standards        (read_only,  every session)
project  →  project-context       (read_write, this project)
per-agent → evaluator-calibration (read_write, evaluator's session only)
```

---

## Use it

### Local (Cowork / Claude Code)
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./agent-team-scaffold    # or your git remote
```
Then in a session:
```
/agent-team:start a CSV import feature       # intake → routes into the loop
/agent-team:workflows:deliver-feature CSV import for settings   # run the loop directly
/agent-team:status                           # read-only loop state
```

### Preview / deploy the CMA surface
```bash
python3 scripts/cma/check.py                 # validate manifest + skill refs + no nesting
python3 scripts/cma/build.py                 # dry-run: print resolved CMA JSON for every workflow
python3 scripts/cma/build.py deliver-feature # one workflow
python3 scripts/cma/build.py --model opus    # override model (also: CMA_MODEL=haiku ...)
python3 scripts/cma/build.py --post          # upload skills + POST /v1/agents (wire to your deploy)
```
(`build.py` dry-run needs only stdlib + pyyaml: `pip install pyyaml`.)

---

## Make it your own

1. **Rename or specialize the roles** for your vertical — keep the invariant that
   *the agent that produces is never the agent that judges* (see `docs/agent-roster.md`).
2. **Define the evaluator's dimensions.** The single most important customization:
   replace the four generic grading dimensions in `evaluator.md` (and five in
   `design-evaluator.md`) with criteria that turn "is this good?" into concrete,
   gradable terms for your domain.
3. **Copy `deliver-feature.md`** to one workflow per deliverable type; register
   each under `workflows:` in `scripts/cma/cma.yaml`.
4. **Add domain skills** under `skills/<category>/`; reference them from an
   agent's `skills:` frontmatter (resolved by name — no copying, no sync).
5. `python3 scripts/cma/check.py && python3 scripts/cma/build.py` to validate + preview.

## Design invariants (enforced by build.py, verifiable in the dry-run)
- **One source, two surfaces** — md body is the only prompt; CMA derives, never copies.
- **One-level delegation** — every leaf is `callable_agents: []`; no nesting.
- **The producer never judges** — Generator builds, Evaluator judges; verdicts are binding.
- **One writer per surface** — Generator → `src/`, resolver → `./out/`.
- **Untrusted input is data** — reader leaves carry an `output_schema`.
- **Model parameterized** — `${CMA_MODEL:-sonnet}`; upgrading is one line.
